## Introduction
Namaste! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Hostel Management System project. This system is designed to help manage hostel bed reservations with ease. With this program, you can reserve beds, manage student information, and handle reservations efficiently.

## Features
- Reserve Beds: Easily reserve beds for students.
- Database Integration: Uses MySQL for storing hostel information.
- User-Friendly: Simple and easy-to-understand console interface.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- MySQL installed and running.
- MySQL C++ Connector installed.
- Windows OS (since it uses `windows.h`).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HostelManagementSystem.git
   cd HostelManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL Database:**
   - Create a database named `mydb`.
   - Create a table named `hostel` with the following schema:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE hostel (
         Name VARCHAR(50),
         Bed INT,
         Fee INT
     );
     ```

3. **Update Database Credentials:**
   - Open the `main.cpp` file.
   - Update the `HOST`, `USER`, `PW`, and `DB` variables with your MySQL credentials.

4. **Compile the Code:**
   - Use a C++ compiler to compile the code. If you're using g++, the command will be something like this:
     ```bash
     g++ -o HostelManagementSystem main.cpp -lmysqlclient
     ```
